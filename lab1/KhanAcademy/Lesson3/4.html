<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> It’s very important to choose good meat. I prefer neck but not loin because neck is juicier. I wrote the volume for meat I had. When buying meat, count approximately 200-250 g per portion (except for kebab when I count 400-500 g per person). Cut the meat into pieces of 2-2.5 cm thick. I got 8 good pieces. Sprinkle with salt and pepper each piece (I used fresh ground pepper with lemon). Heat the oven until 180 degrees.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Peel onion and cut into rings. Place on a baking pan coated with foil. I recommend to peel the onion and place it on a pan one by one to avoid preparing extra.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Put the meat on top of the onion – this is secret number 1 – this way it will be juicy and soft.
</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Grate the cheese on a big grater and top the meat. The spicier cheese is, the tastier meat you will get. I recommend Cheddar. I had Mimolette (the taste resembles Cheddar), that’s why it is orange.
</p>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Top with mayonnaise – this is secret number 2! I understand it’s not very convenient but you will get the ideal crust. Not cheese on top of mayonnaise and not cheese mixed up with mayonnaise but first cheese, then mayonnaise. Place in a pre-heated oven for 40-50 minutes until the meat is ready. When you see the golden crust, it’s ready.
</p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Serve with boiled potatoes. Or other boiled vegetables. Our dish is fat and rich, so boiled vegetables will make the taste well-balanced.
